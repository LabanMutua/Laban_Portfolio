# [Project 2: Diabetes Prediction Model]()
This project involved building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on several diagonistic measurements.

## Key Highlights:
- **Dataset Overview:** Analyzed a healthcare dataset containing information on medical history, age, BMI, and other relevant features to predict diabetes risk.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and scaled features to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Development:** Developed and evaluated several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to identify the best model for accurate predictions.
- **Model Performance:** Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure robust predictions and minimized errors.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provided insights into the most suitable model as well as appropriate alternatives.
- **Tools and Technologies:** Implemented using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in Jupyter Notebook.



# [Project 3: E-commerce Data Analysis](https://github.com/LabanMutua/E-Commerce-Data-Analysis)
Developed an end-to-end analysis pipeline for an e-commerce dataset to derive insights on customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

- Analyzed over 540,000 transactions to identify key patterns in sales, customer spend, and product returns.
- Engineered new features such as TotalPrice and NetRevenue to better quantify financial performance.
- Created visualizations of sales trends, top products, and geographic distribution to communicate key findings.
- Provided actionable recommendations to optimize inventory management, customer engagement, and global sales strategy.
- Implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
